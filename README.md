[Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) is an open-source, cloud-native policy engine that allows organizations to declaratively enforce policies across their software stack. It provides a unified, flexible, and efficient way to implement and manage policies for access control, security, and compliance in modern, dynamic environments.

This package provides a Julia interface to the OPA server, and the client APIs to interact with the server. It also includes a command-line interface to the OPA command-line tool.
