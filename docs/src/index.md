# OpenPolicyAgent.jl

[Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) is an open-source, cloud-native policy engine that allows organizations to declaratively enforce policies across their software stack. It provides a unified, flexible, and efficient way to implement and manage policies for access control, security, and compliance in modern, dynamic environments. OPA excels at decoupling policy decision logic from application code, enabling fine-grained control over authorization, resource validation, and more.

Its expressive policy language, called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego), allows users to define complex policies in a human-readable format. OPA is widely adopted in cloud-native ecosystems, helping organizations ensure consistent policy enforcement across services, APIs, and infrastructure components, making it a crucial tool for enhancing security and governance in modern software systems.

This package provides a Julia interface to the OPA server, and the client APIs to interact with the server. It also includes a command-line interface to the OPA command-line tool.
